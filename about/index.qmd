I am currently employed as an associate biomedical scientist at Precision biomarker laboratories, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

During my postdoctoral fellowship, I worked in Prof. Martin R. Larsen's lab at the University of Southern Denmark on developing a pipeline for identifying post-translationally modified biomarkers in clinical samples.

I pursued my PhD from University of Turku under the joint advisorship of Prof. Riitta Lahesmaa and Dr. Robert Moulder. During the course of studies, I worked on identifying and validating the serum protein biomarkers for type 1 diabetes and carotid atherosclerosis.

Before enrollment into the PhD study, I gained my first level of research experience with my master thesis in the area of proteomics and mass spectrometry at National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) under the joint supervision of Drs. Mahesh J. Kulkarni and B.Santhakumari, after which I continued as a teacher in college of pharmacy and then as a research assistant again at NCL.
