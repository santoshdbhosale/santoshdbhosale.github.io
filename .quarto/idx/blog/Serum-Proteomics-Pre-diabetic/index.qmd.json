Currently the measurement of autoantibodies (Aabs) like islet-cell autoantibodies, protein tyrosine phosphatase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin and zinc transporter Slc30A8 protein indicates the manifestation of β cells autoimmunity and increased disease risk. However, the destruction of β cells usually starts early in life and symptoms appears when 90% of the cells are destroyed. The time period of appearance of first Aabs to the onset of the clinical disease can vary from 1 month to over 10 years, moreover, not all Aab positive subjects develop T1D. Thus additional indicators of early disease process and progression are needed.

The DIPP cohort has collected blood serum samples at 3 to 6 months intervals from children with a genetically conferred T1D risk and tested for T1D associated autoantibodies. **These longitudinal series of samples cover all the stages of disease progression from birth to clinical T1D and matching samples from carefully matched healthy children.**\n\nWe utilized such unique samples from the DIPP cohort to identify early serum protein biomarkers associated with T1D using quantitative mass spectrometry based approach.
