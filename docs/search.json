Bhosale, was trained as a pharmacist and currently working as an associate biomedical scientist at Cedars-Sinai Precision biomarker laboratories, Los Angeles, CA, USA.\nUsing the versatility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, I am exploring the properties of biologically important proteins.\nPrecisely, I work on mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies to address the questions related to biomedical research. These includes not only the qualitative and quantitative measurement of proteins, but also their post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins. I use computational methods to understand the complexity of proteins."

    "text": "Type-1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by the destruction of the insulin producing β cells in the Islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Currently the measurement of autoantibodies (Aabs) like islet-cell autoantibodies, protein tyrosine phosphatase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin and zinc transporter Slc30A8 protein indicates the manifestation of β cells autoimmunity and increased disease risk. However, the destruction of β cells usually starts early in life and symptoms appears when 90% of the cells are destroyed. The time period of appearance of first Aabs to the onset of the clinical disease can vary from 1 month to over 10 years, moreover, not all Aab positive subjects develop T1D. Thus additional indicators of early disease process and progression are needed. To identify disease associated changes, a careful selection of study group is essential such as The Finnish Type-1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention project DIPP has initiated in 1994. The DIPP cohort has collected blood serum samples at 3 to 6 months intervals from children with a genetically conferred T1D risk and tested for T1D associated autoantibodies. These longitudinal series of samples cover all the stages of disease progression from birth to clinical T1D and matching samples from carefully matched healthy children.\nWe utilized such unique samples from the DIPP cohort to identify early serum protein biomarkers associated with T1D using quantitative mass spectrometry based approach. The study involved LC-MS/MS analysis with both iTRAQ and label-free quantification strategy on the immunodepleted serum.\nPrevious serum proteomics biomarker studies of T1D have typically compared disease end points with control groups, i.e. the differences between patients with T1D and healthy controls. In contrast to the published reports, to our knowledge we have shown for the first time serum proteomics profile of pre-diabetic children, mapping the changes from early infancy, seroconversion and diagnosis. The main finding included lower and higher levels of APOC4 and AFAM in cases compared to controls respectively and, the combination of this two proteins classified T1D developing children from controls with 91% success rate with an area under the curve value of 0.85. Notably the levels of APOC4 were found to be lower even before seroconversion."

    "text": "Proteins represent the key interacting biomolecules in the complex network within the cell and their interactions are crucial in orchestrating all aspects of life at the molecular level. Most biochemical functions are not carried out by a specific protein in isolation but by the multiple protein in associations refereed as a protein-protein interactions (PPIs).\nAffinity purification-based mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a technique of choice in discovering PPIs. These experiments are usually carried out by coupling a bait protein to the protein A or immunoglobulin G (IgG) surfaces or an affinity matrix followed by purification of tagged protein from a cell lysate. Additionally, suitable negative control replicates are mandatorily included to define the non-specific background. The composition of PPIs are then delineated by mass spectrometry analysis. These types of studies are useful in understanding the complicated interplay of proteins inside the cells for generating new hypothesis or may be helpful in placing a specific interactor in a pathway to explain observed phenotypes.\nWe used AP-MS method to study interactome of FOS related proteins (FOSL1 and FOSL2) in human Th17 cells. The fate of Th17 cells is regulated by various transcription factors such as BATF, IRF4 and STAT3. Furthermore, the members of the activator protein (AP-1) family including ATF, FOS and JUN also modulate the differentiation of Th17 cells. Of these AP-1 members, FOS related proteins regulates variety of processes such as cancer progression, embryonic development and immune cells signaling. In order to understand how FOS related proteins mediates signaling mechanism in Th17 cells, we performed their interactome analysis.\nThe analysis resulted in the identification of 163 and 67 proteins for FOSL1 and FOSL2 respectively. These interactors have passed certain criteria including mass spectrometry interaction statistics (MiST) algorithm scores with the matching IgG controls and they were mapped against in house common contaminant detected in related AP-MS experiments.\nFurthermore, we validated the interesting binding partners of FOSL1 and FOSL2 by western blotting and parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The shared interactors between FOSL1 and FOSL2 as depicted in below figure were mapped against the STRING database to construct a network using Cytoscape.\n\nThe gene ontology based molecular functional analysis were performed by ClueGO and CluePedia apps built in Cytoscape."

    "text": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of mortality and morbidity in developed world. Thickening of the carotid arterial wall (plaque formation) are indicative of active atherosclerotic process. Myocardial infarction and stroke are the clinical events associated with an acute rupture of a critically located atherosclerotic plaque. Currently, ultrasonic assessment of carotid artery intima media thickness is used as a pre-clinical marker of the disease process. Nevertheless, atherosclerotic process may remain asymptomatic for several decades and whether thickening of intima-media layer of carotid artery and carotid plaque represents two different phenotypes or single traits of disease process is still unclear.\nTo gain insights into the pathophysiology of pre-clinical atherosclerosis and identify novel biomarkers, we conducted the serum proteomics measurements on the unique sample set of participants recruited in The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. We performed label free quantitative MS analysis of serum samples obtained from the subjects in whom early signs of plaques were discerned together with matched controls. The serum samples were immunodepleted to remove high abundant proteins prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.\nThe profiling results indicated differential abundances in a set of proteins. Furthermore, selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry analysis were performed on undepleted serum samples to verify the observed differences. Finally, machine learning analysis identified a panel of three proteins P23142-4 (Fibulin 1 proteoform C), P02649 (Apolipoprotein E) and P55290 (Cadherin-13) which segregated the cases from controls with best discrimination (an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.79.).\n More details about the data analysis can be found here."
