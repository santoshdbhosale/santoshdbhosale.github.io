# Understanding the Complexity of Proteome!

Hi, I'm Santosh D. Bhosale, pharmacist by training and using the versatility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, I am explored the properties of biologically important proteins.

Precisely, I worked on mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies to address the questions related to biomedical research. These includes not only the qualitative and quantitative measurement of proteins, but also their post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins. I used variety of computational methods to understand the complexity of proteins.
