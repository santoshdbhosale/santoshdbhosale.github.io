# Understanding the Complexity of Proteome!

Hi, I'm Santosh D. Bhosale, pharmacist by training and currently working as an associate biomedical scientist at **[Cedars-Sinai Precision biomarker laboratories](https://www.cs-pbl.com/)**, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Using the versatility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, I am exploring the properties of biologically important proteins.

Precisely, I work on mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies to address the questions related to biomedical research. These includes not only the qualitative and quantitative measurement of proteins, but also their post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins. I use computational methods to understand the complexity of proteins.
