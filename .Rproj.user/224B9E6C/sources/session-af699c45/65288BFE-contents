I really like Methods in Molecular Biology book series. They publish step by step protocols with detailed information on materials and methods to carry out the experiment in a reproducible manner. In particular notes section provides useful tip and troubleshooting guide.

We published a protocol entitled **[Mass Spectrometry-Based Serum Proteomics for Biomarker Discovery and Validation](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7057-5_31).** 
It presents a workflow detailing sample preparation with and without immunodepletion of high abundant serum/plasma proteins and, LC-MS/MS methodology for discovery and targeted measurements of candidate biomarkers.
